#Github Child Component

We now want to see the data from our **githu_user.js** file. 

Create a file to present our users data. We are going to call that file, **GithubApp.js**. The reason why we uppercase the file name is because this will hold a class component, so we are sticking with a file and naming convention. We will start with our imports.


Now at this time we don't have a component created named **GithubCardList** and that's fine, it's all apart of our road ahead. 

```js
import React from 'react';
import GithubCardList from './GithubCardList';
import { GithubUserData } from './github_user';
```

After we have the imports let's construct the rest of our component, 

```js
const GithubApp = function () {
    return (
        <div className="main">
            <div className="mainDiv">
                <GithubCardList cards={GithubUserData}/>
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}

export default GithubApp;
```

What type of componenet is this?

**Functional Component**

Next we will see how we can start to think about how to style the data accordingly.

You see in this line of code:

``` js 
<GithubCardList cards={GithubUserData}/>
```
That we are passing the **GithubCardList** props. Then we set the value of the props with the data that is coming from our **github_user.js** file.
