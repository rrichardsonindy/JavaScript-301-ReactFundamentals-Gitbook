# Concept List App

Our next app will be a little twist on a typical to do list application, with a focus on keeping track of your progress of understanding react components. 

### What We're Going to Build & Learn
- A list app where you can add items, and cross them off when they're done
- Going to learn more about state and lifecycle methods. 
- More about functional components, and ES6

### Getting Started

To get started, we need to set up our routing to be able to access the application and our folder structure! 

Inside of `Sidebar.js` insert the following link:

```js
<li><Link to="/reactconceptlist">React Concepts Checklist</Link></li>
````

In `_routes.js` add the following route.

```js
{
      path: '/reactconceptlist',
      exact: true,
      main: () => <ReactConceptApp />
    }, 
```

Now, in our folder structure we need to make create the folder for our app. Underneath (and outside of) your timer-apps folder, create a new folder called `concept-list-app`. 


```
    └── src
        └── assets
        └── components
                └── apps
                    └── timer-apps
                    └── concept-list-app
       
```

Inside of this folder, we're going to start with creating our parent component for our app called `ReactConceptsApp.js`. After you create your parent component, go ahead and set up the basic component, by typing out the following code.

```js
import React, { Component }  from 'react';

export default class ReactConceptsApp extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div className="main">
                <div className="mainDiv">
                    <h1>Concept List App</h1>
                    <p>Use the list below to toggle concepts that you do or do not understand. Note that this will update when you refresh the page.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

Next, we're going to set up the data for the concepts that we want to include in our app!
