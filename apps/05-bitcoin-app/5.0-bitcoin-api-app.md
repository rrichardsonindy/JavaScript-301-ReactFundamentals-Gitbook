#Bitcoin Api Challenge

Your challenge is to build a component that shows data about Bitcoin over the last 30 days. 

You do not have to know about Bitcoin to do this. You are merely showing the data over time. 

Please use this [endpoint](https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/historical/close.json) to show the data over the last 30 days.

If you'd like to see a great usage of the endpoint, there is a great tutorial that you can find [here](https://codeburst.io/how-i-built-an-interactive-30-day-bitcoin-price-graph-with-react-and-an-api-6fe551c2ab1d).

Do your best. You do not have to use a graph. It could simply be a list, or you could just do the tutorial above and fit it into this application.
