# 6.2: Props Challenge \#1

Here is a short challenge to allow you to practice using props. A possible answer is on the next page. Try not to move ahead unless you are extremely stuck.

Using the same Class Component, we need to add three more simple props to our component:

* author
* codepenUrl
* description

Make it so that all three of these are required properties, and set default properties for all of them.

Please call four instances of the component with the following alphabetical data:

```text
title: Beast with Beard
author: Adam Smith
codepenUrl: https://codepen.io/Adamws33/pen/KZQxwJ
date: 01/15/2018

title: Celtic Beast
author: Allison Summers
codepenUrl: https://codepen.io/alsummers/pen/jYzyZZ
date: 01/15/2018

title: Beast from Caracas
author: Andres(Dre) Martin
codepenUrl: https://codepen.io/dreMartin/pen/eyVLGN
date: 01/15/2018

title: Beast with the Flu
author: Andrew Gunst
codepenUrl: https://codepen.io/agunst99/pen/RxMYOM
date: 01/15/2018
```

Here's what you should have by the end. Don't worry about styling for now.
