# Common Errors
Here are some common errors that we see with React. These account for about 70% of beginner errors:

* Did you save the file after changing?
* Do you have an import statement for the component?
* Is everything in the return wrapped in one element?
* className is used, it's not class.
* Does the component have an export statement somewhere?
* Does the class component extend { Component }?
* Are putting that non-component, like routes, in there without { }?
* Are you trying to put your components inside {}?
* import { concepts } from './concepts';
