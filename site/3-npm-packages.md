# npm Packages

To expedite the set up process and to get you learning React faster, we're going to give you the dependencies in package.json file and just have you run `npm install`. This will bring in a number of packages that we will use along the way. We might add more packages in the future, but this will be a good amount just for saving time. Go ahead and replace the `dependencies` and `devDependencies` sections in your `package.json` with the following code:

```js
{
    *****************NOTE: CODE OMITTED****************
  "dependencies": {
    "aframe": "^0.7.1",
    "aframe-animation-component": "^4.0.0-beta9",
    "aframe-particle-system-component": "^1.0.11",
    "aframe-react": "^4.3.0",
    "axios": "^0.17.1",
    "babel-polyfill": "^6.26.0",
    "bootstrap": "^4.0.0",
    "lodash": "^4.17.4",
    "node-sass-chokidar": "0.0.3",
    "npm-run-all": "^4.1.2",
    "react": "^16.2.0",
    "react-codepen": "^0.1.0",
    "react-dom": "^16.2.0",
    "react-icons": "^2.2.7",
    "react-router-dom": "^4.2.2",
    "react-spinners": "^0.2.5",
    "reactstrap": "^5.0.0-alpha.4",
    "youtube-api-search": "0.0.5"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "react-scripts": "^1.1.0"
  },
     *****************NOTE: CODE OMITTED****************
}

```

After you do that, just run `npm install`. Again, we'll talk about what these dependencies are doing as we go through the project.

Remember that React is a library, and you end up using A LOT of third party dependencies when creating a React application. We'll discuss common ones that are universal to many applications, and we'll use a few more lesser known dependencies as well.

If you have any issues with your install, please talk to your instructor.
