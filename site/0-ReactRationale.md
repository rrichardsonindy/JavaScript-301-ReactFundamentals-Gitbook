# Part 1: Intro and Set up

### React Intro
React is a JavaScript library. Much like jQuery it is a single file, created and maintained by Facebook. It is component-based, which means that you can use Components to describe your desired outcome for very specific areas on the webpage. For instance, we might have a component for nav, footer, main, counter, etc. 

###Rationale
As of today React is one of the top 3 tools for using JavaScript on the front end. Because of its speed, quick learning curve, reusability of components, and performance, React is enormously popular.

### Pros
- Uses JSX - JS that looks HTML.
- Works in tandem with vanilla JS.
- Reusable components.
- Has its own Dev Tools.
- React Native - native mobile development.
- Facebook supported.
- Fast rendering, includes a virtual DOM.
- Awesome SEO performance.
- Great debugging.
- Functional development friendly.

### Cons
TODO: Research and draft
- It's only the view (can be a pro).
- Have to use things like webpack, etc. for easy development.
- Can be difficult to get your brain initially into react mode.
- Lots of third party packages to make your life easier are almost needed.
