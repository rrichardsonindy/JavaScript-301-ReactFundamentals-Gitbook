# 10.0 - Sound Cloud App Challenge

Challenge: _Your task is to use a music or sound api to build a custom music/sound application._

## Context

Four students in our last track had to do the following:

_Use React with TypeScript to write an app using the Spotify Api to make a users playlist. Use MongoDB, Express, and Node.js for a backend._

They had one week to do this, and they succeeded!!! They hired one of our students for the job.

## Challenge Starter:

While we're not asking you to build a full stack music app, we are asking you to build some kind of sound or music component.

You can find some great examples from [react.rocks](https://react.rocks/tag/Audio). All of those applications have demo applications and sample code available. You should cite any application that you use in your `README.md` file and in your code, as we have done throughout our application.
