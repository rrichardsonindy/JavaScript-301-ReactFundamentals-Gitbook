# 7.1 - The Users

Before we pull data from an API, let's start with pulling some sample data from a file and creating a list from that.

We will create a file called **github\_user.js**, this file will be an array of objects that we will iterate over it's data.

Inside of that file type the following:

```javascript
export const GithubUserData = [
  {
    name: "Paul O'Connor",
    avatar_url: "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7937273?v=4",
    company: "Eleven Fifty"
  },
  {
    name: "Kenn Pascascio",
    avatar_url: "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7727018?v=4",
    company: "Eleven Fifty"
  }
]
```
