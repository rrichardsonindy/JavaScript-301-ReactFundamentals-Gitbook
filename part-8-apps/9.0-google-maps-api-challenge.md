# 9.0 - Google Maps Api Challenge

## Challenge:

The challenge here is simple. Create an application that uses the Google Maps api. Feel free to let this be a starter for the capstone project. If you don't use it for a project, at least make a small app with it so that you can get some experience with this api.

## Tutorial

If you need something to help get you started, here is a great [tutorial](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/how-to-write-a-google-maps-react-component/) that will give you some ideas. If you'd like to build something on top of this tutorial, that is fine. Also, if you'd just like to complete this tutorial and add it to your library, that would be fine, too.

You can find the source code [here](https://fullstackreact.github.io/google-maps-react/#/?_k=p7bidm). If you find a different source that you like better, feel free to use it. There are plenty of others to be used out there.
