# React Fundamentals - Version 3.0

### Introduction

Think of this as your starting guidebook to React. In this book we have culled together some of the best online resources, added our own touches, and written some of our own applications and tutorials.

In the next few weeks we hope to see you have have the following:

* A greater understanding of JavaScript in general, especially ES6.
* A starter application for a tutorial site about React.js to show off to employers.
* 5-10 smaller demo React applications.
* A larger capstone app: a full stack React, Node, & Express application with individual user accounts that stems from your own ideas. 

### Overview of Phases
Here's where we'll be going:

1. *Clone*: Go ahead and clone our starter application, if you haven't already. You can find the repo and set up instructions in the README.md file [here](https://github.com/ElevenfiftyAcademy/JavaScript-301-ReactStarter).

2. *Orientation:* Walk through Part 1 of this Gitbook in an instructor led group. We'll discuss the code that you've cloned and tactics for getting started with a React application. We have instructions that you'll look through for now, but you'll have these for when you need to create your own app from scratch. All the directions are there.

3. *Fundamentals*: In Parts 2-7 we'll start by covering the basics of React. We'll write small chunks of code, and you'll make the beginnings of your own online tutorial application. This can be a nice portfolio project. Yes, while you learn React, you will learn to teach React, too.

4. *Mini Apps*: In Part 8, we will move into bigger mini-apps to help you reinforce important topics, give you some challenges, finish up on your main project, and also include tons of helpful resources for you to continue learning.

5. *Big App*: In Part 9 you will work on the big project application that you will work on for the Blue Badge and beyond. We will tell you the requirements for this project later midway through this week.


### We are pumped
We are pumped!!! Stoked!!!!

We hope you have a lot of fun with the applications within this application that will help you build your bigger application. *Inception* anyone?

### Feedback:

While we've taught React fundamentals many times in the past, this is our first edition of this Gitbook. We are happy about it and have worked hard so that you can have the best starting resource possible. We have tested the code, read through it, and reteseted it. But we know there will still be typos and bugs. There are a lot of moving parts here.

Please follow the following guidelines for feedback:

*typos*: If you see a typo, you don't have to scream it from the rooftop. Just post a message on the 301-feedback channel. Give us the Part #, module number and approximate location, please. 

*bugs*: If you think you've found a bug, let an instructor know before posting to the whole group. Let us look. Then, we'll give you the go ahead to post, and we will help fix it.


### To Start Gitbook: 

We'd prefer if you read this book online for now.

However, we'll also give you the code for running the book locally later in the week.

When we are done in a few weeks, we'll open source the finished code for this book, and you can have your own local edition of it. 

1. Clone the Gitbook
This will be available later this week [here](https://github.com/ElevenfiftyAcademy/JavaScript-301-ReactFundamentals-Gitbook). 

2. Install the Gitbook CLI: 
`npm install gitbook-cli -g`

3. Then run: 
`gitbook install`

4. Then run:
`gitbook serve`
