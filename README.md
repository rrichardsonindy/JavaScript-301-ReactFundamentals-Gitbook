# Part 0: App Overview

![efa](.gitbook/assets/efalogo.png)

## React Fundamentals

### Introduction

Think of this as your starting guidebook to React. In this book we have culled together some of the best online resources, added our own touches, and written some of our own applications and tutorials.

In the next few weeks we hope to see you have have the following:

* A greater understanding of JavaScript in general, especially ES6.
* A starter application for a tutorial site about React.js to show off to employers.
* 5-10 small React apps.
* A larger capstone app: a full stack React, Node, Postgres, & Express application with individual user accounts. 

### Overview of Phases

Here's where we'll be going:

1. _Setup & Orientation_: In part 1, we'll set up our application so that we can dive further into React. Instead of just cloning an application, we're going to walk through setting up one together! We'll introduce some topics in this section that we'll go more in depth on later. 
2. _Fundamentals_: In Parts 2-7 we'll start with a solid once over of important concepts in ES6. Then we'll proceed by covering the basics of React. We'll write small chunks of code, and you'll make the beginnings of your own online tutorial application. The fundamentals project can be a nice portfolio project that you can eventually make your own.
3. _Mini Apps_: In Part 8, we will move into making mini-applications to help you reinforce important topics, give you some challenges, finish up on your main project, and also include tons of helpful resources for you to continue learning.
4. _Big App_: In Part 9 you will work on the big project application to be completed for the Blue Badge and beyond. We will talk more about the requirements for this project in the coming weeks.

### We are excited

We are pumped!!!

We hope you have a lot of fun with the applications within this application that will help you build your bigger application. _Inception_ anyone?

### Feedback:

We are constantly improving our curriculum and materials, so there may be some material in this book that you are the first to use in the classroom. We have tested the code, read through it, vetted resources, and retested it. But we know there may still be typos and bugs.

Please use the following guidelines for feedback:

_typos_: If you see a typo, you don't have to scream it from the rooftop. Just slack one of your instructors, preferably Carolyn. Give us the Part \#, module number and approximate location, please.

_bugs_: If you think you've found a bug, let an instructor know.

_suggestions_: Send Paul a note if you have good ideas or ways that this could be improved.
