# Props

So, if you go study props in React, you'll often read that 'props' are simple. They are just 'properties'. While this is true, we find that it's not so simple to learn. In fact, for even midlevel developers, props will twist your head around. Let's see if we can get you some straight ahead understanding of working with props in React.

Here are a few important things to know about props:

* are received from above from a 'parent' component.
* are immutable, although they can change depending on state.
* are properties, a way to confgure a component

These are just some starter rules to be aware of. Let's get started on messing around with props. Like everything else, this is a primer, just to get your feet wet.
