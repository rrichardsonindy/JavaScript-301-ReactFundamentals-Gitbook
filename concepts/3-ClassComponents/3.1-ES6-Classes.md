# ES6 Classes

If you don't already know, classes are a part of ES6. Classes are one of the most commonly used tools in React to build dynamic components, so it helps to have a strong foundation with classes before using them with React. Classes are not a new part of programming. Java, C#, and many other Objective Oriented Languages have classes, which act as a blueprint for creating objects that share methods and properties. Enough chatter. Let's get started.

### Creating a class

Let's create a class called User:

```js
//ES6 JS Classes
class User {
    constructor(name){
      this.name = name;
      this.type = "Trial User"
    }
    //Method 1
    greet(){
      console.log('Welcome back, ' + this.name);
    }
    //Method 2
    status(){
      console.log('Current status: ' + this.type);
    }
  }
```
So, for this module, let's ignore the constructor. We'll discuss that in the next module. As a new developer classes can be a tough concept to grasp, but we like to explain a class as a sort of blueprint for making objects. We'll also talk about it as a cookie cutter. If you have to make 1000 cookies for a 1000 kids, you are going to need a cutter. You're not going to use a knife, right? A class is the cutter that cuts objects. Each of these objects can have different properties, just like we can put white, red, blue icing on the cookies.

### Making Objects/Instances
We'll add to this class and break it down in future modules, but for now, let's learn to make objects/instances of the class. We make instances or objects from the class using the `new` keyword.  Here's how we do that:

```js
  //Instance of the class/new object
  var anonDude = new User("Anonymous dude");

  //we can now use the instance and the . operator 
  // to access the 2 methods
  anonDude.greet();
  anonDude.status();
  
  //Another instance of the class
  var anonLady = new User("Anonymous lady");
  anonLady.greet();
  anonLady.status();

   //Another instance of the class
  var jeff = new User("Jeff");
  jeff.greet();
  jeff.status();
```
When we run this we get the following result:

### Notes
Here are a couple things to note:
1. We have three different instances of the User class. 
2. The . operator allows each instance of the class to 'access' the methods in the class.
3. Each instance has a different result in the console based on the string that is passed in to the constructor. Let's talk about that now.
