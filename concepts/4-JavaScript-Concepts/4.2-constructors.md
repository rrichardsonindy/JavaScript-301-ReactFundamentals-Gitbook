#Constructors

The constructor method is a special method that helps create and initialize an object created from a class. It works in tandem with the `new` keyword.


```js
class User {
    constructor(first, last, e) {
        this.f = first;
        this.l = last;
        this.email = e;
    }
}

var userOne = new User("Paul", "O'Connor", "poconnor@elevenfifty.org");
console.log(userOne.first); //undefined
console.log(userOne.f); //Paul
console.log(userOne.l); //O'Connor
console.log(userOne); //User {f: "Paul", l: "O'Connor", email: "poconnor@elevenfifty.org"}

```

Make sure to run the app at this point and check your values in the console.  So here's a breakdown of the constructor, line by line:

```js
//We name the class
class User {
    //We call the constructor function and create parameters.
    //These will be values that we want to be passed in and stored in the object.
    constructor(first, last, e) {
                //On the right side of these expressions, the word 'first', 'last', and 'e' below, 
                //we have the value that is getting passed into the parens when the object is created.
                // vvv
        this.f = first;
        this.l = last;
        this.email = e;
        //^^^^^^^^ 
      //On the left side we have the actual properties of the object. 
      //The left side stores the incoming value from the right side as 
      //the property for 'this' specific object being created.  
    }
}
```

So, think about why `console.log(userOne.first);` comes back as `undefined`.
In JavaScript, undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. When we log `userOne.first`, it's undefined because that property doesn't exist. While it is the parameter name in the constructor, it's not a property on the object. We could write `console.log(userOne.spaghetti)` and get the same result.

We would actually get the same thing if we tried this `console.log(userOne.stuff);`. Essentially in this case, we're trying to create a property called 'stuff' that doesn't exist as a property on our object. Currently, our properties are on that left side with `f`, `l`, & `email`.  By the way, usually we wouldn't write our properties with this clunky naming. This is simply a way to show you how this all works. We recommend that you reread all of this. You won't get it on the first pass.

###Practice

You don't really understand this concept until you go write classes of your own. Try writing a Player class with three properties of name, number, and average points.  Or try writing a Car class with make, model, and year. Whatever you do, make sure you have a firm grip on constructors before you go on. You can do all this in the same file.
