# .map()

If you don't know the .map() method already, you need to know it. If you already know what it does, it doesn't hurt to practice it. 

Let's add our data to the file, just an array of instructor objects, that includes their name and special skills:
```js
const instructors = [
    { name: 'Quincy', specialty: 'Quantum Mechanics' },
    { name: 'Kenn', specialty: 'Norse Mythology' },
    { name: 'Paul', specialty: 'Tuvan throat singing' },
    { name: 'Aaron', specialty: 'Entomology' },
    { name: 'Carolyn', specialty: 'Kung Fu' }
]
```

Let's say that we want to iterate over this array and print just the names of the instructors. We'll use a for loop:
```js
let instructor_names = [];

for (let i = 0; i < instructors.length; i++) {
    instructor_names.push(instructors[i].name);
}
console.log(instructor_names);
```

What do we have to do here:
1. Manage the index.
2. Check the length.
3. Increment.
4. Create an empty array.
5. Etc. 


We have to create an empty array to push the names into as we iterate through. This approach is fine for learning programming, but with ES5, the .map() function came along to make things more sleek for common tasks like iterating through a collection. 

Here it is:
```js
const instructorNames = instructors.map(instructor => instructor.name);
console.log(instructorNames);
```

Notice a few things here:
1. We create a variable called instructorNames that store the result as an array of objects.
2. We are calling .map on the instructors array: `instructors.map`.
3. The `instructor` parameter in .map can be named anything, usually something related to the array. See how this is the exact same thing:
```js
//Exact same thing, different parameter name 
const instructorNamesTwo = instructors.map(i => i.name);
console.log(instructorNames);
```

4. The .map() function requires a return value. This is a key rule of using .map(), so the fat arrow is taking care of that requirement. 

5. Get some practice. Try the following. Fix the code: 

```js
const instructorInfo = `${instructor.map(instructor => ${instructor.name}: ${instructors.specialty}`)}`;
```


### .map() and React
As stated, you'll see .map() everywhere. We recently had a student be asked to do this for a job interview. The [question](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) came straight from the MDN docs and was based on this code. Study up!!!  

```js
var kvArray = [
    { key: 1, value: 10 },
    { key: 2, value: 20 },
    { key: 3, value: 30 }
];

console.log(kvArray);

var reformattedArray = kvArray.map(obj => {
    var rObj = {};
    rObj[obj.key] = obj.value;
    console.log(rObj);
    return rObj;
})
```
