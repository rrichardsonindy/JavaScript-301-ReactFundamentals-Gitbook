# Part 2: Fundamental React Concepts

Some of the great things we'll study in this part include the following:

- **Components**: This is one of the best parts about React. Everything is broken up into separate reusable components. This makes app flow and debugging a whole lot easier!

- **JavaScript**: One of the great things about React is that you can use it in tandem with vanilla JavaScript. So be ready to sharpen your skills with plain old-fashioned JavaScript here.

- **JSX**: JSX is a syntax used in React components that looks very similar to HTML. If you know HTML, you can write a React component in a relatively short amount of time.

- **Props**: Props are a nice way of passing data around the app and down through components. 

- **State**: You'll learn a lot about how the state of an application changes and how we can see state changes without having to rerender the entire DOM.

- **Lifecycle Methods**: There are lifecycle methods for components that allows you to run functions at certain times. For instance, if I need to fetch all my data before a page loads, I can run a method that fetches that data. 


We'll start with the simplest component type, the "Functional Component".
