# JSX
Before we talk about class components, it's probably important that we discuss JSX. It might surprise you to know that we have barely written any HTML at this point. In fact, the only HTML in our app is in the index.html. The rest is called JSX, which stands for JavaScript XML. Let's start by looking at a translated snippet of JSX code. Copy the following code and go to babeljs.io and paste the following code.

### Challenge
1. Create a functional component called JSXRules.
	* Resembles HTML - It's not HTML. Closer to JS.
	* React.createElement() - Used to construct and update the DOM.
	* Not required - Developers don't have to use JSX. 

2. Use the Arrow Function to create the component.
3. Take your component

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Component } from 'react';

const JSXRules = () => {
	return(
		<div className="main">
			<div className="mainDiv">
				<h1 className="section-title">JSX</h1> 
				<dl>
					<dt>Resembles HTML</dt>
					<dd>It's not. It's actually closer to JavaScript.</dd>
					<dt>"React elements"</dt>
					<dd>These are used to construct and update the DOM, or what you see on the screen.</dd>
					<dt>JSX is not required</dt>
					<dd>You can write in Vanilla JS, but most sane people use JSX.</dd>
				</dl>
			</div>
		</div>
	);
}
```

This looks like some crazy hybrid of JavaScript and HTML! Really it's just a different syntax for JavaScript. You can embed JavaScript expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces. 


The most important thing to notice below is the way JSX treats classes. Since it is like JavaScript, React DOM uses camelCase in naming. So instead of class, you use className. This also happens because class is already a keyword in React(remember Class Components?).
